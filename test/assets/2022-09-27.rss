			<title>ITP Awareness Week</title>
			<description>Wednesday, September 28, 2022 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Victoria Bridge will be lit Purple to support ITP Awareness Week&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annual ITP Awareness Week campaign raises awareness for those living with the rare disease ITP. As with many rare diseases, many ITP patients never get the chance to meet another patient in person, so by lighting up various structures purple across the country, we provide local patients with the knowledge that they aren&amp;#8217;t in this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITP is a rare autoimmune blood disorder where the body&amp;#8217;s immune system attacks platelets. Platelets assist the blood to clot and patients with ITP have a low platelet count. Patients with ITP can suffer from a vast range of symptoms including spontaneous bleeding, bruising, fatigue, anxiety and mood changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light Up is organised by: ITP Australia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="javascript:Nav(&amp;#39;objectid=964861&amp;amp;objecttype=19243&amp;amp;seotitle=Victoria-Bridge-Brisbane-City&amp;amp;key=7fb8dfadd72e32a53654b0bd1ad46fc6&amp;amp;view=object&amp;amp;-childview=&amp;amp;-index=&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;detailBase&amp;#39;)"&gt;Victoria Bridge, Brisbane City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue address&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=-27.4722996,153.0188074(Victoria+Bridge%2c+Brisbane+City)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Victoria Bridge, Brisbane City&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<xCal:description>The Victoria Bridge will be lit Purple to support ITP Awareness Week&amp;nbsp;

The annual ITP Awareness Week campaign raises awareness for those living with the rare disease ITP. As with many rare diseases, many ITP patients never get the chance to meet another patient in person, so by lighting up various structures purple across the country, we provide local patients with the knowledge that they aren&amp;rsquo;t in this alone.

ITP is a rare autoimmune blood disorder where the body&amp;rsquo;s immune system attacks platelets. Platelets assist the blood to clot and patients with ITP have a low platelet count. Patients with ITP can suffer from a vast range of symptoms including spontaneous bleeding, bruising, fatigue, anxiety and mood changes.

The National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) is Australia&amp;rsquo;s leading national body funding game-changing breast cancer research with money raised entirely by the Australian public. We receive no government funding. What we do, would not be possible without the support and generosity the community. Our mission is simple: stop deaths from breast cancer. How?

National Amputee Awareness Week is held from 4 - 11 October 2022. This event is a chance to celebrate Australians living with limb loss, raise awareness of this disability, and reduce community stigma. Limbs 4 Life will use this awareness campaign to feature the stories of everyday Australian amputees and illuminated buildings to &amp;lsquo;shine a light&amp;#39; on amputees across the country. It is also a chance to assist the community to become &amp;lsquo;amputee aware&amp;rsquo; and reduce the risk of preventable amputations.

This Light Up is organised by: Limbs 4 Life Incorporated</xCal:description>

			<xCal:description>The Tropical Dome will be lit Purple to support The Development Language Disorder (DLD) Awareness Day

Raising Awareness of Developmental Language Disorder (RADLD) is a volunteer, international group whose vision is a world where people with DLD are supported to pursue their goals and aspirations. RADLD partners with the community to foster a substantial increase in international awareness of DLD. Despite affecting 7.6% of the population, Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) remains a hidden disability for most people around the world. DLD affects a person&amp;rsquo;s ability to understand and use their native language for no known reason. This has significant repercussions for a person&amp;rsquo;s academic outcomes, mental health and employment. You can find out more about DLD at &lt;a href="http://www.radld.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.radld.org&lt;/a&gt;

This Light Up is organised by: Raising Awareness of Developmental Language Disorder</xCal:description>
